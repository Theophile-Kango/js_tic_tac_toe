# Tic Tac Toe (Javascript)
In this project, we will be building a Tic Tac Toe game on Javascript.

# Rules and how to play it

- When you open the app, you and your friend should input your names and click "Start";
- Here are some rules for Tic Tac Toe: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe);
- Player 1 starts the match with the "X" color;
- Player 2 starts the match with the "O" color;
- A score and a message announcing the winner/draw are displayed at the top of the board;
- You can reset the game by pressing the "reset" button at the bottom of the board.

## Built With

- JavaScript
- Jest
- HTML5 
- CSS3

## Requirements

- Keep your code clean.
- Do not commit console.log to your repo. - It‚Äôs ugly, it kills performance and it can make confidential data be visible in the browser tools.
- Keep the number of changes/updates to the DOM as low as possible, they are very expensive for the browser.
- Keep the application logic separated from DOM manipulation tasks.
- Keep all the styling logic in CSS files.
- Use object destructuring to get the values from an object. This way you can avoid repeating a lot of code.
- Create separate test file for each class or module.

### Setup

- Clone the repository on your local machine
- Cd into the folder
- Run `npm start`
- Open your browser and type `localhost:8080`
- To run tests, type `npm run test`

### Install

- Install VSCode or any code editor you like
- Install npm by running `npm install`
